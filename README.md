These are just a couple tools I coded for use where I work. 

Features include a

* one-click language applicator,
* "singular data" finder,
* word list generator,
* word frequency generator,
* proper noun discrepancy checker,
* one-click "accept formatting changes," and
* comment boilerplate manager.

The language applicator applies the language to *all* text, including notes, headers, and footers. Text boxes and frames may be skipped. I haven't done extensive testing around those.

The proper noun checker looks for proper nouns that sound similar or that differ by a customizeable editing distance. Useful for catching common typos in names.

The word list generator creates an alphabetized list of all the unique words in the document. Useful for proofreading.

If you find yourself making the same comments over and over, the boilerplate manager can save you some time. The export/import features lets you share comment boilerplate with others or move them between machines.

If you have suggestions for new tools, or if you have any questions, let me know.

## "Real" Editing Tools

Do *not* confuse this with the most excellent ["Edit Tools" by wordsnSync](http://www.wordsnsync.com/). Also check out [PerfectIt](http://www.intelligentediting.com/) and [the Editorium](http://www.editorium.com/). If you're looking for macros instead of plugins, check out [Paul Beverly's excellent book of macros](http://www.archivepub.co.uk/book.html).

## Disclaimers

I can't guarantee that this code will work in your version of Visual Studio or Word. Microsoft does not make that sort of maintainability easy!

I'm just sharing this because a couple people asked for the code. If you find it useful, great!

If you just want to see the algorithms, then you'll be most interested in the files `Ribbon1.cs` (which contains the code that runs when you click a ribbon button and describes the overall algorithms) and `TextHelpers.cs` (which contains all the little helper functions that make writing the algorithms easier).
